 Kana no quiz - README
 version 2.0 - in development 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Introduction
 ============

 This is ``Kana no quiz", a little educational tool, simple yet efficient, to
memorize Japanese kana (hiragana & katakana) pronounciation in an easy way,
and thus accomplish the first step in learning the language, without much pain.

 The full list of kana is implemented, including additional katakana used in
modern language. Default used transcription system is the Hepburn's (most
common world-wide), but it does also support Kunrei-shiki, Nihon-shiki and
Polivanov (cyrillic) systems.

 Written in Python, this program is cross platform: the same package works on
Unix (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X...) and Windows, using the same GTK+
interface on every platform.

 How does it work?
 -----------------

 The method is quite simple: a kana appear randomly and the user has to find
its transcription ; either by choosing the correct answer from a random list
containing several possibilities (number is selectable) or by directly typing
the answer through a text entry. This second method of course is more
complicated.

 Progressive learning
 --------------------
 
 Through its option panel and full kana tables, Kana no quiz allows you to tune
up the quiz precisely, like choosing which group of kana you want to train
yourself upon.

 First, hiragana and katakana are separated, both are then divided into big
sets of kana according to their type (``Basic", ``Modified", ``Combined"; and
a special ``Additional" set for katakana only) which are thus composed of
various portions mostly containing 5/6 kana, following the traditional alphabet
order (i.e.: ``ka ki ku ke ko").

 According to your need and level, you may select one or more portions of the
same or different sets, whole sets, all the kana... Once you feel comfortable
(you can check it with the results displayed at the end of each quiz), you may
also increase the number of possible answers in the random list, or even choose
to answer directly through the text entry. Difficulty can be adapted to your
skill: this is progressive learning.

 From the complete beginner who has to start easily and learn step by step, to
the wizard who just wants to confirm his/her absolute master of the kana,
everyone should get satisfated with Kana no quiz!

 To run fine, Kana no quiz requires the following softwares to be priorly
installed on your computer:

* Python - `http://www.python.org/'.
* For the GTK+ interface:
  * The Gimp Tool Kit - `http://www.gtk.org/'.
  * PyGTK - `http://www.pygtk.org/'.

Optional:
  * Psyco (to increase program speed performance) - `http://psyco.sf.net/'
  * SDL & PyGame (to hear kana prononciation sounds) - `http://www.libsdl.org/'
    and `http//www.pygame.org/'.

(Windows user, please note that *all* those dependencies are included in the
Kana no quiz all-in-one installer)

 Program installation
 --------------------
 
 This process depends on your package type and platform.

 On Windows, simply install Kana-no-quiz using one of our graphical, binary
installers (either the single Python package or the popular ``all-in-one").

 On GNU/Linux, like other Unixes, if not using any distro-specific package but
the classic source code, simply enter `python setup.py install' as root to
install Kana-no-quiz.

 Launching
 ---------

 On Windows, just click on the shortcut created in the Start Menu.

using Inkscape, with the hope they could also be reused for other purposes,
by people who enjoy them. So, the source SVGs have been made publicly available
(see our website), under the conditions indicated above.
