 Kana no quiz - Changelog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Version 1.5 (2006-05-12):

- System-wide installation & per-user configuration.
- More complete quiz result informations (wrong answer recap).
- Windows binary installation package.
- No more learning flow disturbance within a quiz using the
text-entry answering method.
- Added possibility to extend random answers selection range
from the same portion to the same kana set or kind.
- Added Polivanov's kana cyrillization system.
- New Russian translation (made by Aleksej R. Serdyukov).
- New German translation (made by Florian Niemann).
- A quit button added to the main window.


* Version 1.4b (2006-01-01):

- Language confusion between Serbian & Swedish with the
Tkinter interface corrected.
- Update of the Swedish translation.


* Version 1.4 (2005-12-14):

- You can now choose several portions of the same kana set to
train upon in the same time (if no portion selected in a set,
that one becomes disabled :p).
- Random list answer mode now permits up to five choices. :p
- Support for the 2 other popular romanization systems: the
Kunrei-shiki's and the Nihon-shiki's. (Because they are really
less used worldwide than the Hepburn's, choosing one of these
systems remains for people who know what they are doing.)
- Some informations are now displayed during the quiz (romani-
zation system used and question number) and you can choose to
stop it after every answer (useful for example if you realized
the quiz you began to perform is truly too difficult).
- Bug fix: no more endless quiz!
- Some improvements over the GTK+ interface, and replacement
of the depracted widgets.
- Addition of a marvellous icon (GTK+ version)!
- Translations update (except for Brazilian).

Now the ``kana engine" should be clean ! :-D

list mode, of getting the right answer appearing twice in
the list.
- The interface type used by Kana no quiz is now indicated
in the ``About" window (in case that you don't see! ^^).


* Version 1.2 (2005-01-23):

- The Sweedish translation has been finaly updated.
- In the GTK version, we can choose the length of the quiz
from 1 to 200 questions.
- Addition of a new option to not repeat the same kana
during the quiz (as much as possible: a kana might appear
several time if the quiz lenght is bigger than the number of
selected kana).


* Version 1.1 (2004-09-25):

a row any more. :p
- A new ``Introduction" window which briefly introduce the
Kana writing system and what this program is aimed to.

kana rather than the full kana set, it may be helpful for
the beginers! ^_^;

- Addition of the ``additional" katakana question set which
contains syllabes used for foreign words.
The sets are now: ``Basic" (formerly ``Single"), ``Modified",
``Contracted" (formerly ``Combined") & ``Additional" (for
katakana only). In other words: *ALL* kana have been (normally ;)
implemented into Kana no quiz. ^_^
- The answers can now be typed directly through a text entry
rather than selected from a list. It's harder! ^^;
- The option panel has been slighty redesigned.
- Program translation into Portuguese of Brazil.
Unfortunately, the Sweedish translation has not been updated. ;(

warn you. :p
